      "description": "RT sculptured this statue of Lord Buddha in August 1960, immediately after his arrival in Switzerland. He did so in anticipation of soon raising 20 Tibetan children in the traditional Buddhist way, while living in a Christian environment. RT was determined to complete this first task in one go, before meeting any of the donors of Pestalozzi Children's Village. Mr. Bill, the director of the institution, often shared how embarrassed he felt when he had to postpone all the pre-arranged meetings with donors due to RT's insistence. Over all the years, this statue used to be part of the house alter in Yambhu Lagang.",

      "description": "Painted in Delhi to be presented in 1960 to Dr. Arthur Bill, Director of Pestalozzi Children's Village (1949-1972). Many decades later, before Mr. Bill's move to the old age home, RT and his wife were invited to Mr. Bill's home place in Gerzensee BE. There Mr. Bill asked RT to write some few words for him on this painting, but returned the painting to RT together with a beautiful Tibetan sword which he received from H.H. the Dalai Lama at their first meeting. Mr. Bill believed an old age home wasn't the right place for these cherished gifts, but asked RT to find a place to keep them in his memory. Dr. Arthur Bill passed away in 2011 at the age of 95.",
