                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        Is such a collected edition still timely, and is it of use for anyone or anything? When this project began, the answer to that question seemed simple. Rakra Tubten Choedar belongs to that small group of Tibetan scholars whose works are equally highly regarded within exile Tibetan circles as well as in Tibet. Over the years his writings were published in book form, as articles in Tibetan journals, or in very small self-published editions. Some works are no longer traceable. For example, an extensive manuscript on the life of Mahatma Gandhi—written in the late 1950s—disappeared unpublished. Additionally, a beautiful biography of Trijang Rinpoche, spanning about 400 pages, appeared in the final weeks before the completion of this publication. This biography was published in 2022 without the knowledge of the family and has apparently circulated in PDF form. A collected edition, and the effort that comes with it, therefore made sense. Tracking down missing articles and correspondence, as well as comparing different versions of a text—some of which existed only as digital files on his hard drive—were part of the requirements. Fortunately, the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives agreed to take on this major task, and many people contributed to the project's success. And yet, even after the completion of this collected edition, the question of its purpose arises once more.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="foreword-subheading">Witness to a Turning Point</h3>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        I want to approach this question from the perspective of a family member and as someone who knows only a fraction of his writings and lays no academic claim to legitimacy in reflecting on Tibetan literature. It is clear to me that the perspective of a son will inevitably be marked by certain biases. In my defense, I may point out that the publisher, repeatedly requested that I, as co-initiator of this project, write a text with the character of a foreword.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        To summarize and state at the outset: these works stem from another era, and perhaps it is precisely for this reason that they may have a value for today's readers that goes far beyond what we ordinarily call "cultural preservation."
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        The entry of Chinese troops marked a Zeitenwende—a turning point—for Tibetan society, as well as for my father. In Tibetan, there is the fitting expression Dus-logs for such a rupture. His works are the testimony of a man who tried with all his might to orient himself in this new world and to find meaning for himself and for Tibetan society. In my view, this collected edition is therefore less about the past than about the future and a contribution to how the Tibetan path into modernity and into the future could look.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        As I write these lines, I am traveling through Kashmir, North India, and Ladakh. This region has long been the gateway for the peoples who gradually conquered and settled India, thereby creating a civilization of global significance on the subcontinent. It was also an important region for the spread of Buddhism and later became the starting point for the second wave of Buddhist transmission to Tibet.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        My father's biography is closely intertwined with this region. His family came from Shigatse but had its roots in the western kingdom of Guge, some 2,000 kilometers away from his birthplace Derge on the upper reaches of the Yangtze, where he was born as the son of the Tibetan general, Gyurme Gyatso Tethong (1884 - 1938). At the age of five, he was formally recognized as the reincarnation of Rakra Trulku of Pakshoe Monastery in the South East of Tibet and much later married a woman from Ladakh, a region closer to the Guge area. These biographical details are important, for they point to Old Tibet and its civilizational expanse. Anyone who understands Tibet only as a national history will fail; we would do well to remain conscious of the cultural heritage of Inner Asia, within which Tibetan civilization flourished. In the case of my father, this was quite naturally and unquestionably true.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="foreword-subheading">A Scholar of Many Worlds</h3>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        It was a blessing in disguise for him—whose interest went in almost all directions—that he underwent a strict education. Although our grandfather initially opposed this life for his son, he ultimately acquiesced at the insistence of the 13th Dalai Lama, who directed that the young boy must become a lama of the Pakshoe monastery. His teacher at Drepung Gomang College was a Buryat scholar, and successfully prepared him for the Geshe examination. He thus attained the best education available in Tibet. With a certain wit and irony, he would later remark that by age alone he could have been a candidate for the Ganden Tripa (head of the Geluk school), had he continued a monastic career and maintained celibacy. The truth, however, is that the breadth of his interests could hardly have been compatible with such a lofty celibate office. He went to Shantiniketan to study Sankskrit and then to Pune to be instructed by Prof. Vasudev Gokhale. He developed a strong interest in classical Indian dance, and loved theater, film, photography, cooking, painting, poetry, had a weakness for good wine and fascination for the opposite sex, and above all a passion for everything related to Tibetan language.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        He grew up at a time when national feelings in Tibet were steadily increasing. His father belonged to the golden generation of Tibetan leaders and military officers who, under the leadership of the 13th Dalai Lama, sought a path toward independence for Tibet in a new era.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        This was mainly due to a world undergoing upheaval since the turn of the century, in which the old empires could barely hold their ground against national movements and eventually had to admit defeat. My father's enthusiasm for all things national stood in tension with his nostalgia for the ancient diversity and history of Tibet. For him, the value of Tibetan civilization certainly did not lie in modern demarcations—of thought, culture, or maps. On the other hand, the loss of homeland and the path into exile drove his longing and pain for a Tibetan nation—free and equal among other peoples—almost to the point of unbearable intensity.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        I remember the long storytelling evenings in Trogen, Appenzell. Thousands of kilometers from Tibet, separated by oceans, mountains, and deserts, he would tell us, evening after evening, stories from Tibet—personal memories, historical dramas, tales of Tibetan saints—but never trivial gossip. We children adored him. He was a born storyteller and had a marvelous storyteller's voice. It didn't matter that we were only five, six, or ten years old and hardly able to contextualize these stories. We understood them intuitively and loved being transported into this foreign world, which at first glance had nothing at all to do with our Swiss present. But we came to see that what mattered in these stories was less their place or time than the deeply human experiences they conveyed. Children see with their hearts. My father knew that.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        Looking back, I realize how unbroken his connection was to this world of stories, and how effortlessly he could shift from an Indian fable to a Tibetan ghost story and then to a tale about Milarepa. It helped that he could clearly draw from a deeply lived experience of a civilizational sphere. That experience is only limitedly accessible to us, the next generation.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        The military occupation of Tibet by China severed Tibet from its neighboring cultural realms. The Chinese army's entry into Tibet was both a political and cultural rupture for all of Inner Asia and its southern neighbors—and for our family, as for many Tibetan families, a traumatic experience, bearable, if at all, only through political action.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="foreword-subheading">Language as a Lifeline</h3>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        My father always saw himself as a person of modern Tibet. Of course, he was not a representative of Tibetan modernity to the same degree as Gedun Choephel. The famous scholar from Amdo who taught my father to have a fresh look on history, Buddhism and poetry in all its forms, brought the discourse of modernity—at great personal cost—into Tibetan society.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        Throughout his life, his Gedun Choephel remained an intellectual guiding star. With this giant of Tibetan scholarship my father shared a fascination for culture, language, and history. Knowledge of Tibetan culture was for him the foundation, and language the natural gateway to the discourse on modernity. Sadly, today this discourse is hardly conducted anymore, or has been reduced to a few core topics such as Buddhism and science. Too often it is the widespread hysteria of a society struggling with the identity crisis of its youth that dominates this debate on change. Surely this is also because, in our age of postmodern relativism, the appetite for grand societal projects has dissipated.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        It was not always so. There was a time when discussion was pursued with idealism and breadth. For my father, and for many others, language was the key element for modern Tibet. For him it was imperative that we define a common colloquial standard—clear, yet rich and comprehensive in its expressive possibilities. He recalled his time at Drepung Monastery, when monks from various regions, speaking incomprehensible dialects, were nevertheless able to agree on a colloquial standard—admittedly elitist, but egalitarian—and exchange ideas in a simple and respectful way, without being suffocated by the formalities of the Lhasa dialect. I doubt that we are any closer today to achieving a national colloquial language than we were in the 1960s and 70s.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        There was no more meaningful activity for him than to engage with all forms of the Tibetan language. He could spend weeks with passion deciphering ancient Tibetan manuscripts from Dunhuang, only to devote himself with the same intensity to translating an Indian text into contemporary Tibetan. He especially delighted in local Tibetan dialects and the different "slangs" of Lhasa. He imitated these dialects, and for example had a Muslim trader of Tibetan origin appear in one of his yak stories.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        He would also enthusiastically tell us, his overwhelmed children, about Tibetan scholars of the 11th and 12th centuries, such as Geshe Potopa, who succeeded in bringing the Buddha's teachings closer to ordinary Tibetans in plain language and simple stories.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        At the same time, he was endlessly frustrated with new coinages in Tibetan newspapers, which in his opinion amounted only to empty phrases or made no attempt to better grasp the inner rules and subtleties of Tibetan language. He tried his hand at Tibetan comics, illustrations, and at the same time composed a biography of Tsongkhapa in classical verse, which, for me and many others without a Tibetan education, is simply inaccessible.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        He did all this alone, without institutional support and with only the most limited private financial means. He did it out of passion for a language and a civilization whose influence extended far beyond Tibet's political boundaries, and whose intellectual elite harbored no doubts about the significance of their culture.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        We know that the discourse on Tibet's future is complex. It is about more than culture and politics. A discourse on modernity without aesthetic aspirations is a bleak one. In Tibet's case, it cannot only be about preserving culture or debating its aesthetic qualities. It is about the individual effort to create and enjoy creative diversity. Engaging with this collected edition will hopefully reveal a man who, in many ways, set a standard of aesthetics, scholarship, and talent—and who, of course, also failed at his own high expectations. What we learn from this: Tibetan discourse must not be reserved for those who follow the risk-free, simple path of supposedly safe solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p class="foreword-text">
                        My father died at the University Hospital in Zurich on July 10, 2012. He would have liked to live a few more years. On his sickbed lay a copy of The Little Prince by the French writer and philosopher Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which he intended to translate into Tibetan. I never really understood this story of a pilot lost in the Sahara Desert. But it seemed that my father had found a connection to this little lonely prince from a distant asteroid whom the pilot encounters in the desert. Perhaps it is an expression of scholarship and a truthtful life that, like the Little Prince, he understood that the essential is not in the visible world and is ultimately accessible only to the heart.
